## Get-Started

> WARNING: when translating make sure you have CAPS on and that there is spaces between each morse code/letter!

- Dot: `.`
- Dash:`-`

In a Terminal:

```Powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
py .\main.py
```

### TODO

- [ ] Add support for small characters
- [ ] Change the default font so that is shows `.` and `-` render better
